   abstract = {Modern cities are facing critical environmental and social problems that are difficult to solve using conventional planning approaches due to the cities’ magnitude and complexity. Recent developments in sensing technologies and urban computing, however, integrate new data resources and technologies to tackle these challenges. Popular social networking platforms such as Twitter provide new data sources on important events (e.g., cultural activities, political campaigns, accidents, crises) providing rich knowledge about urban systems and human dynamics. This research is intended to develop a method for effectively monitoring important information during such events and helping with planning and policymaking. We use semantically similar and geographically close geo-topics to represent important local events. This research proposes a data-driven system for detecting and tracking the semantic, spatial, and temporal dynamics of these geo-topics, specifically designed for geo-tagged tweets. The system consists of data preprocessing, geo-topic generation, and geo-topic tracking modules. The preprocessing module can remove robotic and semantically trivial texts. In the geo-topic generation module, we use spatial factors to measure the spatial impacts of geo-tagged tweets by applying an exponential decay function to the pairwise distances between tweets. We then improve the dynamic topic model (DTM) by embedding the spatial factors to enable the generation of geo-topics in semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions simultaneously. The geo-topic tracking module monitors semantic change by detecting changes in certain keywords’ probabilities and the volumes of tweets belonging to different geo-topics. This module also uses radius of gyration and trajectory-pattern mining to track and analyze the movement patterns of geo-topics. We employed the tracking system in three disaster cases in different U.S. cities to track small-scale emergencies and crises. These implementations demonstrated the effectiveness of the system for identifying and tracking geo-topics at fine temporal and geographic scales. The system also has strong potential in creating planning-related analyses for policy makers, improving the situational awareness of the general public, and serving as a basis for urban information systems that contribute to smart, agile, and resilient city developments.},

In addition, policy makers in universities can utilize this information in decision making. Different factors have direct influence on the growth and evolution of research topics. These include the funding, community interest and national needs. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Dynamic Topic Modeling approach to discover and analyze the most trending research topics in a set of research areas using a collection of publications from the corresponding research areas. Furthermore, we study the correlation between emerging research trends and the different influencing factors.},

   abstract = {<p> The past few years were marked by increased online offensive strategies perpetrated by state and non-state actors to promote their political agenda, sow discord, and question the legitimacy of democratic institutions in the US and Western Europe. In 2016, the US congress identified a list of Russian state-sponsored Twitter accounts that were used to try to divide voters on a wide range of issues. Previous research used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to estimate latent topics in data extracted from these accounts. However, LDA has characteristics that may limit the effectiveness of its use on data from social media: The number of latent topics must be specified by the user, interpretability of the topics can be difficult to achieve, and it does not model short-term temporal dynamics. In the current paper, we propose a new method to estimate latent topics in texts from social media termed <italic>Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis</italic> (DynEGA). In a Monte Carlo simulation, we compared the ability of DynEGA and LDA to estimate the number of simulated latent topics. The results show that DynEGA is substantially more accurate than several different LDA algorithms when estimating the number of simulated topics. In an applied example, we performed DynEGA on a large dataset with Twitter posts from state-sponsored right- and left-wing trolls during the 2016 US presidential election. DynEGA revealed topics that were pertinent to several consequential events in the election cycle, demonstrating the coordinated effort of trolls capitalizing on current events in the USA. This example demonstrates the potential power of our approach for revealing temporally relevant information from qualitative text data. </p>},

abstract={Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM) is the ultimate solution for extracting topics from short texts generated in Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter. It requires to be scalable and to be able to account for sparsity and dynamicity of short texts. Current solutions combine probabilistic mixture models like Dirichlet Multinomial or Pitman-Yor Process with approximate inference approaches like Gibbs Sampling and Stochastic Variational Inference to, respectively, account for dynamicity and scalability of DTM. However, these methods basically rely on weak probabilistic language models, which do not account for sparsity in short texts. In addition, their inference is based on iterative optimizations, which have scalability issues when it comes to DTM. We present GDTM, a single-pass graph-based DTM algorithm, to solve the problem. GDTM combines a context-rich and incremental feature representation method with graph partitioning to address scalability and dynamicity and uses a rich language model to account for sparsity. We run multiple experiments over a large-scale Twitter dataset to analyze the accuracy and scalability of GDTM and compare the results with four state-of-the-art models. In result, GDTM outperforms the best model by {\$}{\$}11{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}on accuracy and performs by an order of magnitude faster while creating four times better topic quality over standard evaluation metrics.},

   abstract = {<p>Cybersecurity threats continue to increase and are impacting almost all aspects of modern life. Being aware of how vulnerabilities and their exploits are changing gives helpful insights into combating new threats. Applying dynamic topic modeling to a time-stamped cybersecurity document collection shows how the significance and details of concepts found in them are evolving. We correlate two different temporal corpora, one with reports about specific exploits and the other with research-oriented papers on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. We represent the documents, concepts, and dynamic topic modeling data in a semantic knowledge graph to support integration, inference, and discovery. A critical insight into discovering knowledge through topic modeling is seeding the knowledge graph with domain concepts to guide the modeling process. We use Wikipedia concepts to provide a basis for performing concept phrase extraction and show how using those phrases improves the quality of the topic models. Researchers can query the resulting knowledge graph to reveal important relations and trends. This work is novel because it uses topics as a bridge to relate documents across corpora over time.</p>},
